# User Management

## Basic Guide

This project utilizes the following technologies and practices:

- Node.js: The backend is built with Node.js and MongoDB. The backend is hosted on Heroku, so there's no need to run it locally. Simply start the local project.
- Angular Material: The project uses Angular Material for UI elements, providing a set of pre-built components and styles for a cohesive and responsive user interface.
- NgRx Store with Entity Pattern: The application utilizes NgRx Store, a state management library for Angular, following the entity pattern. This pattern simplifies managing collections of data and provides efficient CRUD operations.
- Standalone Component: The project includes standalone components that can be reused across different parts of the application, promoting code modularity and reusability.
- Lazy Loading: The application utilizes lazy loading to optimize performance and load only the required modules when navigating to different routes, improving initial loading time.
